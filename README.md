## About me

Hi there 👋, I'm Albert. You can call me Ghost. I'm currently working on some public and private projects spread across various frameworks and languages. I’m still learning, trying out new approaches, and improving every step of the way.Yes, I’m from India, and I’ve had a passion for computer hardware and software from a very young age. Networking is also on my bucket list.If you want to reach out to me, you can contact me through Discord for now. I’m looking forward to new opportunities and challenges, and I always try to resolve them in the best way possible. Every line of code gives me a unique feeling and helps me explore this virtual world further.
